Hi, I’m Tazik Shahjahan! [1]   I want to help 🏗️ the future.

A few 🍒-picked anecdotes:
-  I hustled my way into the [#1 high school STEM program](https://archive.macleans.ca/issue/20040823#!&pid=26) in Ontario (after failing math in middle school); 
-  I built a web app to digitize my high school’s archaic paper announcements system, reaching 100+ uses per month;
-  I corresponded with the _Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy_ (SEP), _Brainpickings_, and others regarding typos on their sites.   


At present, I’m experimenting with the effects of layout on speedreading, learning to transfer learn on a [waifu generating neural network](https://www.gwern.net/Faces), and looking for an internship for the Fall 2020 term.
