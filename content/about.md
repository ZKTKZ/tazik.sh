A few üçí-picked anecdotes:
-  I hustled my way into the [#1 high school STEM program](https://archive.macleans.ca/issue/20040823#!&pid=26) in Ontario (after failing math in middle school); 
-  I built a web app to digitize my high school‚Äôs archaic paper announcements system, reaching 100+ uses per month;
- At present, I‚Äôm experimenting with the effects of layout on speedreading and learning to transfer learn on a [waifu generating neural network](https://www.gwern.net/Faces). 


I study [Computer Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/about-electrical-and-computer-engineering) at the University of Waterloo.
