Hi, I’m Tazik Shahjahan! [1]   I want to help 🏗️ the future.

A few 🍒-picked anecdotes:
-  I hustled my way into the [#1 high school STEM program](https://archive.macleans.ca/issue/20040823#!&pid=26) in Ontario (after failing math in middle school); 
-  I built a web app to digitize my high school’s archaic paper announcements system, reaching 100+ uses per month;
- At present, I’m experimenting with the effects of layout on speedreading and learning to transfer learn on a [waifu generating neural network](https://www.gwern.net/Faces).
